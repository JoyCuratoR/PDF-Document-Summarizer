Application of Psychological Flexibility Model to Address
Mental Health in Higher Education
Ania Young

<p> A considerable amount of research in recent decades has been dedicated to stress and burn out
of faculty in higher education settings (Blackburn & Bentley, 1993; Catano, V., Francis L.,
Haines T., Kirpalani, H., Shannon H., Stringer, B., & Lozanksi, L., 2007). Some contribute
faculty work stress to lack of time to complete existing professional demands, such as produc-
tion of scholarly work, teaching, advising, and service. Berg and Seeber (2013) propose that
higher education organizations have amplified the stress by assimilating a corporate business
model that downplays faculty’s need for time to produce scholarship and pedagogy in favor
of attaining financially pleasing outcomes (Berg & Seeber, 2013; Coté, J. E. and Allahar, A.,
2011).

Although it may be true that business corporations are highly focused on fast pace and
competitive race- to- the- top approach at the expense of drowning individual growth and
self- efficacy, there is much that higher education organizations can learn from the corporate
world in the area of developing programs to address employee well- being, mental health, and
burn out. Many large- scale successful business corporations, such as Google, have devel-
oped employee wellness plans that include employee health benefits with affordable co-pays
for mental health services, compassionate listening, and built-in workday breaks with oppor-
tunities for yoga, meditation, and mindfulness practice. Transparency about mental health
and struggles related to work stress is also encouraged and protected. Kelly Greenwood, the
founder of Mind Share Partners, a national non- profit with a mission to improve mental health
in a workplace, describes mental health as the next frontier in supporting movement to ensure
diversity and inclusion in a work settings (Arrons- Mele, 2019). She defines a healthy work-
place as an environment of psychological safety and real understanding of how day-to-day
practices influence mental health. An organization striving to support its employees’ mental
health embraces a process of equipping and empowering managers with skills in how to react
to struggling employees (Arrons- Mele, 2019).

Research on prevalence of mental health challenges and stigma in the workplace setting
is limited (Mind Share Partners’ Mental Health Report, 2019). According to the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 1 in 5 Americans copes with
a mental health condition and up to 80% of people will manage a mental health condition in
their lifetime. Due to persistent stigma, most employees do not disclose their mental health
condition to their managers or colleagues; in fact 95% of employees who have taken time off
due to stress, reported another cause for their absence, such as an upset stomach or a headache.
The annual costs of unsupported and untreated mental health conditions and stigma in a work-
place reach $16.8 billion in lost employee productivity (Mental Health at Work Report, 2019).

The COVID-19 pandemic has padlocked economies around the world and affected educa-
tion systems in most countries. Now more than ever, institutions of higher education need to
figure out ways to be flexible and to alter existing operations in order to support university and
college faculty at both professional and personal levels. Variables that contribute to a support-
ive workplace such as encouragement of self-compassion, open-mindedness, non-judgment,
trust, transparency, and flexibility, need to be recognized as prerequisites to effective com-
mand and appreciation of challenges related to change. Behavioral science can offer powerful
strategies that managers in higher education organizations can adopt to help their employees
at both macro and individual levels.

Psychological flexibility is a model that can offer useful strategies to promote flexible
and healthy behavior in higher education workplace (Moran, 2015). It is a behavioral sci-
ence approach that describes an extensive range of human abilities needed for adaptation to
various situational stresses such as those brought about by the pandemic in the year 2020.
Psychological flexibility provides a model for shifting attitudes and behavioral repertoires
when unproductive strategies compromise private and social functioning. It encourages the
person to uphold balance among important life domains and be mindful, open, and committed
to behaviors that are compatible with deeply held values (Kashdan, 2010). A meta-analysis
of 32 studies found that the psychological flexibility construct was associated with outcomes
ranging from effective job performance to overall life satisfaction (Hayes et al., 2006). The
behavioral repertoire of psychological flexibility involves six elements: 1) present moment
awareness, 2) acceptance of difficult experiences, 3) defusion from unworkable thoughts, 4)
perspective taking with respect to self and others, 5) values identification and clarification,
and 6) committed action (Hayes, 2006).



In context of a work place, present moment awareness, sometimes referred to as mindfulness,
is in its simplest form an act of judgement- free concentration on task. The rise of scholarly
interest in mindfulness has produced multiple lines of research related to inquiry about its ben-
efits in the workplace. Researchers found that mindfulness permits people to view events more
objectively and dispassionately (Shapiro, Astin, & Freedman, B., 2006) and allows them to ad-
just their thoughts, emotions, and physiological reactions more effectively (Lakey, Campbell,
Brown, and Goodie, 2007; Papies, Barsalou, & Custers, 2012). Other research examines the
effects of mindfulness on task performance and shows that mindfulness correlates positively
with accuracy of judgment (Kiken and Shook, 2011), insight-related problem solving (Ostafin
and Kassman, 2012), and academic performance (Shao and Skarlicki, 2009). Moore and Ma-
linowski (2009) found that mindfulness practice enhances mental flexibility and promotes
executive functioning (Zeidan, Johnson, Diamond, David, and Goolkasian, 2010) which are
all qualities central to effective performance across a range of work tasks. For organizations
concerned with employee’s on-task behaviors, especially during challenging times like those
of the pandemic, facilitating mindfulness practice is an endeavor well worth investment at the
administrative level.
Acceptance.
Universities can be stressful environments and interpersonal conflict, deadlines, and scarcity
of time are often unavoidable realities (Berg & Seeber, 2013). In the psychological flexibility
model, the act of acceptance is about the willingness to experience a range of psychological
events no matter how distressing they are. Biron and van Veldhoven (2012) found that making
room for difficult experiences and facing them instead of actively distracting from them, sig-
nificantly increased employee productivity. The act of acceptance leads to a useful habituation
to feelings of discomfort, such as frustration, sadness, disappointment, imposter, or failure,
and research indicates that the more prolonged the exposure to unpleasant and aversive experi-
ences, the less unpleasant and aversive those experiences become (Benito and Walther, 2015).
Faculty may shy away from transparency and disclosure related to uncomfortable feelings,
thoughts, or experiences in fear of becoming undesirably vulnerable to others’ judgements or
crossing professional boundaries (Berg & Seeber, 2013). However, in the past few decades
data on importance of vulnerability in a workplace have grown extensively (Jenkins, 2021).
If skillfully executed, openness to experience and acceptance of personal vulnerabilities do
not have to necessarily blur boundaries and create problems; Rather, they may strengthen the
individual’s personal and professional confidence and psychological stamina (Laloux, 2014).
The ability to accept these experiences is another skill that higher education organizations can
cultivate in order to make their employees more resilient and productive.

The defusion element of the psychological flexibility is an ability to observe one’s thoughts
without allowing those thoughts to dominate one’s overt behavior. It is impossible to always
reign in one’s thoughts, especially in taxing work environments; therefore, such environments
are likely to provoke unproductive thoughts. When defusing from mental rules about how
things should and should not be, an individual engages in flexible thinking and is able to
let go of rigid behavior routines that are interrupted by unpredictable events.An academic
workplace, often characterized by long- standing adherence to traditions and status quo, can
easily lead to rigidity around policies and procedures with chaos and distress ensuing upon
any slight call to change. Employees, who can defuse from prescriptive routines, can think
more flexibly and compassionately about themselves and make room for action that effectively
moves them toward completion of their work tasks.
Perspective taking.
Perspective taking, whether at work, home, grocery store, doctor’s office, or on a social media
platform, is critical to prosocial and successful interactions with others. Perspective taking in
the workplace, similar to defusion, allows one to let go of assumptions about others (Moran &
Ming, 2020). This is especially helpful when assumptions or judgments are those of criticism
and attribution of blame. Perspective taking does not only apply to an ability to empathize,
sympathize, and attempt to see others’ point of view; it also embraces how an individual
views oneself and is able to detach from rigid images of who they represent. Under stress of
meeting a deadline, pursuing tenure or promotion, or ensuring positive student evaluations,
faculty may unintentionally get caught up in their own opinions and judgements that then
get in a way of working collegially alongside of others. Faculty meetings can be a display
of highly opinionated arguments with very little to no reciprocated active listening. Laloux
(2014) suggests that perspective taking is often replaced with ego- driven behavior, something
that can not only destroy relationship with others but also lead to failure in achieving one’s
professional goals. In order for faculty to safely show up as whole individuals and avoid using
the ego as a mechanism to protect from stress and demands of a workplace, higher education
organizations should promote practices that reward flexible perspective taking and compassion
for self and others.


Values refer to selected guidelines for behavior that allow an individual to engage in personally-
relevant actions that may not always be immediately gratifying. (Moran, 2015). Everyday
tasks can be tedious and aversive; the context in which they are executed may require un-
comfortable interactions with coworkers, tough conversations with the boss, and frustration
with lack of time and other resources. An individual can overcome apprehension surround-
ing these tasks by clarifying the values in service of which these tasks are performed. For
example, when a coworker asks for assistance with a tough project, one can agree to help and
then go on to privately grumble about it; alternatively, one can engage in value clarification
and remind themselves that they truly cherish being a valuable colleague thus making it much
more bearable and even satisfying to invest time in helping another. Higher education admin-
istrators typically orient faculty and staff toward department and university mission and vision
statements that are constructed based on values, but the process of arriving at an agreed-upon
standard requires continuous effort to ensure that everyone receives an opportunity to express
not only the organizational values, but also their personal ones.
Committed Action.
The final element of the psychological flexibility is committed action, which calls for employ-
ees’ behaviors to match key performance indicators for the organization’s objectives (Moran,
2015). Where the other previously mentioned elements of psychological flexibility capitalize
on the individual’s strengths to support the group, committed action requires accountability
and a pledge to follow-through on an individual level. It is not enough for employees to reflect
in safe spaces, share their vulnerabilities, and show compassion for those who struggle. In the
end, there is an expectation of accomplishing the organization’s mission. Supporting faculty’s
mental health is about not only the soft approach and kindness, but it also requires everyone
to be accountable for their actions and for using resources to achieve the collective goals. Fac-
ulty’s accountability for actions can be strengthened in the work place with soft skills such as
vulnerability that leaders can encourage and model for their employees. In words of Courtney
Lynch, “Leaders inspire accountability through their ability to accept responsibility before
they place blame” (Morgan, Lynch, & Lynch, 2017).

Higher Education organizations carry a reputation of organized hierarchies (Stevens and Williams,
1988) but they also engage in many practices that are compatible with models like the psychological flexibility model. The push and pull, often characteristic of government operations,
also results in a dynamic that can be useful and supportive of employees’ personal growth and
creativity. The transformation into a more flexible and wholesome model does not happen
overnight and it does not have to involve a total change of practice. Laloux (2014) describes
a possibility for an adoption of selected practices- those that the majority of employees are
likely to value. The first step in the process is a much-needed research to determine useful-
ness of the psychological flexibility in higher education settings. There is enough conceptual
support to encourage such research. </p>
